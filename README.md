# 💬 ICT Hub Chatbot

Welcome to the **ICT Hub Chatbot** — a rule-based conversational assistant built with **Python**, **Gradio**, and **Machine Learning**.  
It provides quick responses to ICT Hub–related queries using an Excel dataset.

## 🚀 Features

- Rule-based fallback for unknown inputs  
- Clean, mobile-friendly Gradio UI  
- Preprocessing with NLTK (stopwords, lemmatization)  
- Supports your own Excel dataset

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Loads `icthub_dataset.xlsx`
2. Preprocesses and vectorizes text
3. Classifies the category using Naive Bayes
4. Returns a response from the same category
5. Shows chat history in Gradio
